This application should visualize weeks for the whole life of a person.

Do do it we need 3 main things:
- date of birth
- life expectancy based on some statistics
- 100 years as the maximum life expectancy

Main features:
- 1 week as a 1 "coin" (point / circle) on the screen
- always show all the weeks for the whole life (up to 100 years)

Calendar features:
- allow to set some specific date and make it with the visual mark (e.g. birth of a child, wedding day, etc)
- allow to set some period in different formats (e.g. specific date, or month/year, or year only) and make it with the visual mark (e.g. university studies, work periods, )

Visual features:
- show the weeks (already lived, current, remaining) in different colors and allow to use different color themes
