# Agent Instructions

Read [README.md](README.md) for project description, features, and tech stack.

## Coding Guidelines

- Use Next.js App Router patterns
- Use TypeScript with strict typing
- Use Mantine components for UI - keep it simple
- Use Tailwind CSS for layout and custom styles
- Follow the folder structure in README.md
- Reuse utility functions from `src/app/utils` - don't duplicate logic
- Use Redux Toolkit for state management (store in `src/app/store.ts`)
